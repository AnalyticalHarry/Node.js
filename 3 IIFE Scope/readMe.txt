How IIFE Works for Scoping
Function Scope: In JavaScript, functions create a new scope. That means variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from outside the function. An IIFE is simply a JavaScript function that is executed immediately after itâ€™s created, which utilizes this scoping rule to shield its contents from the external scope.

Encapsulation: By wrapping your module's code inside an IIFE, you encapsulate the module's internal details. This is particularly useful in environments where block scoping (using let and const with {}) is not enough or when trying to avoid polluting the global namespace.

Privacy: Variables like count in your IIFE example are private. The methods increment, decrement, and getCount have access to count through closure, but since count itself is not exposed outside the IIFE, it remains protected and cannot be directly manipulated by external code.

IIFE in Node.js Context
Although Node.js modules each have their own scope (thanks to the CommonJS pattern), using an IIFE within a module can still be beneficial for:

Immediate Execution: If there are setup tasks or initialization code that should run immediately when the module is loaded.
Extra Encapsulation: To further control what is exposed by the module, beyond what the module.exports allows.
