CommonJS is a module system for JavaScript that defines a standard for structuring modules and their dependencies. It specifies how modules should be defined, exported, and imported, making it easier to organize and reuse code in larger applications.

In CommonJS, each file is treated as a module, and you use the require() function to import modules and the module.exports object to export them. This pattern allows you to create encapsulated and reusable chunks of code, making your codebase more maintainable and modular.
