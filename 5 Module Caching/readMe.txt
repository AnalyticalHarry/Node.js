Module caching in Node.js is a mechanism that caches the exports of a module after it is required for the first time. This means that subsequent calls to require that module will return the cached exports instead of re-executing the module code. Let's see how module caching applies to the provided code:

code:

When cartModule.js is required for the first time in app.js using const cart = require('./cartModule');, the code inside cartModule.js is executed, and the exports (i.e., the functions addItem, removeItem, getItems, and getTotal) are cached.

On subsequent calls to require('./cartModule') elsewhere in the application, Node.js checks the cache first. Since cartModule.js has already been required and cached, Node.js returns the cached exports without re-executing the module code.

This behavior ensures that the state (in this case, the products array and its manipulation functions) maintained within cartModule.js is preserved and shared across different parts of the application that require it.

As a result, any changes made to the cart (such as adding or removing items) are reflected consistently across the entire application because they operate on the same shared state maintained within the cached module.
