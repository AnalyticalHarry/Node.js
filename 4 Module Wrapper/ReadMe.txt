app.js: This file contains the main application logic that uses the readText.js module to read from text.txt and textsecond.txt.

readText.js: Module that provides functionality to read text files using the Node.js fs module.

text.txt and textsecond.txt: Data files containing text that your application will read.


Module wrapping refers to the process by which Node.js automatically wraps each JavaScript file (or module) in a function before executing it. 
This function wrapper is essential to how Node.js implements its module system, ensuring that variables and functions defined in one module do not leak into the global scope or interfere with other modules unless explicitly exported and imported.

1. Encapsulation and Scope Management

Module wrapping provides a scope enclosure for everything defined within the module. This means that functions, variables, constants, and classes defined in a module are scoped to that module by default and are not visible to other parts of the application unless they are explicitly exported. This encapsulation prevents global namespace pollution and accidental interference between different parts of an application, promoting safer and more maintainable code.

2. CommonJS Module System

Node.js uses the CommonJS module specification, which defines a system for server-side modules. The automatic wrapping is a part of implementing this specification, which aims to modularize JavaScript code so that each file provides distinct functionality isolated from the global scope.

3. How Wrapping is Implemented

Node.js internally wraps each module’s code in a function that looks something like this:


(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    // Your module code actually lives here
});

This wrapping function is automatically called by Node.js when the module is required, and it's passed several important local variables:

exports and module.exports: These are objects that the module can use to export functions, objects, or primitives so that other modules can use them through require().

require: This function allows the module to import the exports of other modules.

__filename and __dirname: These variables provide the absolute path to the module file and directory, respectively, giving modules the ability to perform operations relative to their own location.

4. Execution and Exporting

Inside this function, the module can execute code and manipulate the exports or module.exports objects to define what it wants to expose to other modules. When the function completes, whatever is assigned to module.exports is returned to any caller that uses require() to import the module.
