/*
Common JS

- Each file is treated as a module
- Variable, functions, classes, etc. are not accessible to other file by default
- Explicitly tell the module system which parts of our code should be exported through module.exports or exports
- To import code into a file, use the require() function

/*
EcmaScript Modules or ES Modules or ESM

- At the time Node.js was created, there was not built-in module system in JavaScript
- Node.js defaulted to CommonJS as its modules system
- As of ES2015, JavaScript does have a standardised module system as part of the language itself
- That Module system is called EcmaScript Modules or ES Modules or ESM
